# Employee Directory

## Overview
Create a employee directory with React. This required me to break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.


## Business Context
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
